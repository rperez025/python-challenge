##Module 3 - Python challenge

#PyBank

For this challenge, I created a Python script to analyze the financial records of my company using the dataset in [budget_data_(RP).csv](https://github.com/rperez025/python-challenge/blob/main/PyBank/Resources/budget_data_(RP).csv), which included a column for "Date" and "Profit/Losses."

The script analyzes the records and calculated the following:
  * Total number of months included in the dataset
  * Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * Changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and the average of those changes
  * Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  * Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

**RESOURCES AND REFERENCES**

During the challenge I referenced the following to aid in the understanding and completion of the assignment:

* Reviewed all the class activites in GitLab Working Folder - reperforming a majority of them
* Watched the following Dr. A instructor videos:
  - [Variables in Python](https://youtu.be/mnH7HZod9BA)
  - [If Statements in Python](https://youtu.be/BJPr1iOLuW4)
  - [If / Else Statements in Python](https://youtu.be/xm_ZiP-JaaY)
  - [If / Else If Statements in Python](https://youtu.be/C0HYv6CuqRM)

* I used google to search for additional references to further understand the following:
  - [How to access CSV file using OS module](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60190232/how-to-access-csv-file-using-os-module)
  - [Understanding the different Python numbers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-numbers/)

  - [Understanding Python list() Function](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/list)

* I also used the following codes as references for performing my assignment. Specifically, I would review both codes and gain an understanding of their organization. I would then incorporate my knowledge and practice from the class activities, instructor videos, and independent research to write my scripts for both PyBank and PyPoll.
  - [Salllym code](https://github.com/Salllym/PyBank_PyPoll_Analysis/blob/main/PyBank/main.py) - for PyBank
  - [Salllym code](https://github.com/Salllym/PyBank_PyPoll_Analysis/blob/main/PyPoll/main.py) - for PyPoll
